  title: Heya Farmer!
  author: John Farmer
  bodyContent: 'You might not know me, but I''m another farmer that got land as part
    of the Act! I''ve always been advocating for this Act, and now that the Act is
    in place, us farmers finally get the land and recognition we deserve!


    Anyways,
    did you know that compost can appear all around the farm? You can pick them up
    and use them to compost on the land you own no problem! I look forward to hearing
    of your success, fellow farmer!


    Regards,'
