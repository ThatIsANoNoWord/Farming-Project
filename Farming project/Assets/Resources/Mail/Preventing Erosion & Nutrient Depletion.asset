  title: Preventing Erosion & Nutrient Depletion
  bodyContent: "Hello Farmer!\r\n\r\nAs you buy more land, you might find it difficult
    to use all of your land at the same time. However, try not to keep any of your
    plots empty for too long. The roots from plants help hold soil in place, preventing
    erosion, so barren plots can have more runoff than we\u2019d like. If you don\u2019t
    want to plant on your land, at least put some compost on it to preserve nutrients
    and quality!\r\n\r\nSaludos,\r\n<i>Farmer Natalia</i>\r"
