  bodyContent: "Heya Farmer!\n\nYou might not know me, but I'm another farmer who
    also got land as part of the Food Sovereignty Act! \n\nHere's a quick tip: you'll
    often find materials around your farm that can be composted\u2014don't let them
    go to waste! You can bury them in your land to improve the soil quality! I'd
    recommend using the Conuco technique. It's a traditional Puerto Rican farming
    method where crops are planted on small mounds that help maximize land use and
    preserve soil fertility. \n\nI look forward to hearing about your success, fellow
    farmer! <b>\xA1Vamos pa'lante</b>\n\n<i>Farmer Jos\xE9 Rivera</i>"
