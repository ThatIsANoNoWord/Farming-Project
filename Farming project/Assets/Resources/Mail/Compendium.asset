  title: Compendium
  bodyContent: "Hello, my fellow farmer!\n\nHave you taken a look at the crops you
    can grow? There should be a compendium on your farm that gives you all the details
    about the different crops available.\n\nKnowing what to grow is a key part of
    farming! If you're low on cash, you might want to focus on crops with high returns.
    If you need extra compost, go for the ones that yield the most. Trust your instincts,
    and you'll do great!\n\nBest of luck,\n<i>Farmer Jos\xE9 Rivera</i>"
