  title: A Thankful Family
  bodyContent: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for the work you\u2019ve been
    doing on the farm. My sons and I just purchased some of your produce that you
    sold at the store, and it was the best we\u2019ve ever tasted. I\u2019ve never
    seen my kids enjoy healthy food so much! Of course, part of the reason is because
    most of our healthy food is shipped from thousands of miles away, so it isn\u2019t
    too fresh by the time we get our hands on it\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyways, the point
    is, you\u2019re doing a great job and really making a difference in these kids\u2019
    health. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!\r\n\r\nGracias de nuevo,\r\n<i>David
    Diaz</i>\r\n"
