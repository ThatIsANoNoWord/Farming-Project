  title: Storm Season
  bodyContent: "Hola!\r\n\r\nAs the storm season approaches us, I\u2019m trying to
    reach out to all of the farmers around here that are working as part of the food
    sovereignty act and encourage them to plant more high-yield crops.\r\n\r\nBecause
    of our food sovereignty issues here on the island, oftentimes, when we\u2019re
    hit with hurricanes in the storm season, days and weeks can go by without shipments
    of food. Local farms like yours are game-changing, and by planting more <b>high-yield</b>
    crops and selling them, you give aid workers like us a chance to purchase your
    goods and distribute them to those who need it most. Please plant accordingly!\r\r\n\r\nMuchas
    gracias,\r\n<i>Elena Alvarez</i>\r\n"
