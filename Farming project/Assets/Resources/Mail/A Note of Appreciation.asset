  bodyContent: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m Julia, a member of the town council, and I
    just wanted to reach out and thank you sincerely for your work on the farm! A
    lot of our townspeople have struggled with food insecurity in the past because
    everything is shipped from overseas, but your food has been of great help in
    alleviating those issues and making sure people are fed.\r\n\r\nKeep up the great
    work!\r\n<i>Councilwoman Julia</i>\r"
