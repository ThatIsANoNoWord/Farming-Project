  bodyContent: "A Tip from <i>Farmers\u2019 Weekly Magazine</i>:\r\n\r\nCrop rotation
    is a great way to maintain soil quality whilst still planting crops. Because
    different plants use up different nutrients, planting the same crops on the same
    soil again and again can lead to nutrient imbalances in the land. Instead, rotate
    out different crops every time you replant, so the soil has the time to regenerate
    necessary nutrients, and your land can remain healthy and productive!\r\n"
