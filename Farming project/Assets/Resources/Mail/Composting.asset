  title: Composting
  bodyContent: "A tip from <i>Farmers\u2019 Weekly Magazine</i>:\r\n\r\nNot all of
    your produce needs to be sold; sometimes composting your extra produce is the
    way to go! Not only does it give the worms some delicious food to eat, it also
    can help your soil stay healthy through dry spells, where less organic matter
    is found around the farm. Prepare ahead and you will reap the benefits!\r\n"
