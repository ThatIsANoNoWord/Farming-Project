    land to develop on, we lose resources that can be used to feed our community.
    Be sure to keep your eye on the prize, and maintain your focus on buying <b>back
    the land and revitalizing it to health</b>. Don\u2019t get sidetracked by distractions.
    The community thanks you for your efforts.\r\n\r\nFrom,\r\n<i>A concerned community
    member</i>\r\n"
