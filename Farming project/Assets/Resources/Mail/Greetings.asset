  title: New Farm
  bodyContent: "Welcome to your new farm in Puerto Rico! As part of the Food Sovereignty
    Act that has been passed through the government, you now have ownership over
    some land to farm on! Puerto Rico\u2019s fertile soil offers a great chance to
    grow and thrive.\n\nExpand your farm by earning money and purchasing more land.
    If you\u2019re able to reclaim all of the land and prove that your farm is stable
    enough to survive for a while, then we may expand the Food Sovereignty Act to
    help more farmers across Puerto Rico.\n\nYour journey could spark a new wave
    of local farming. \nGood luck\n\nJosu\xE9 E. Rivera\nSecretary of Agriculture"
