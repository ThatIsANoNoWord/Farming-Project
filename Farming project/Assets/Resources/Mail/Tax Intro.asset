  title: GOBIERNO DE PUERTO RICO - TAX NOTICE
  bodyContent: "As a participant in Puerto Rico\u2019s Food Sovereignty Act, you
    are entrusted with land that is vital to our island\u2019s future. To ensure
    the sustainability of this initiative, all farmers are required to pay a recurring
    agricultural tax. This tax helps maintain the program and expand it to more communities
    across the archipelago.\n\nThe agricultural tax is collected every 6 days. Failure
    to pay will result in the forfeiture of your land rights under the Act. Your
    commitment not only secures your own farm, but also supports food justice and
    local resilience across Puerto Rico.\n\nThe next tax is due tomorrow. The exact
    amount will be provided in due time. Prepare accordingly, and thank you for being
    part of this new movement toward sovereignty.\n\nCon respeto,\nLinette D\xEDaz
    Mel\xE9ndez\nDepartamento de Agricultura Comunitaria"
