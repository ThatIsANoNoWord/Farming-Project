  bodyContent: "Welcome to Conuco!\r\n\r\nHere are a couple tips to get started:\r\n1.
    Use the WASD keys to move, and SPACEBAR to interact.\r\n2. Explore everything
    interactable so that you understand the core mechanics of the game. \r\n3. Enter
    the house to sleep, which passes time and causes plants to grow, get composted,
    and get sold.\r\n4. Anything you don't use each day will rot away! Make sure
    to use everything you have.\r\n5. Seeds are delicate, and will always be stored
    in the seed bank. If they seem to disappear, that's probably where they went!\n6:
    <b>WARNING</b>: Try not to bury your crops by putting compost down and creating
    a mound over them. Those crops will be lost!\r\n\r\nGood luck and have fun,\n<i>Almighty
    Creators</i>"
